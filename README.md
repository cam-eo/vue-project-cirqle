# THE CIRCLE vue-project by CAM\

## Short summary

I used the screenshots that were provided in the [original assignment that was shared](https://github.com/HiCirqle/frontend-assignment-2022). I did not put any comments in the code because I think it is pretty straight forward to follow since the two critical components in the assignment are in their own Vue containers.

I did not use any libraries in this project, I think for this task it is not needed.

I would probably put more animations/transitions into the design to make it a more smooth experience if I were to spend more time on it.

I think in general this can give the reviewer an idea of the intentions etc and of course we can discuss more when we meet.
